# Learning React

In this repository, I'll be adding some of my codes which I wrote during the react training course
from [**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me)


=> **In the fist "hello-react" file , I've added the introductory codes that I've learnt and it contains-**
   - 1.Installing the tools
   - 2.setting up react developer tools for google chrome
   - 3.Creating elements 
   - 4.Introduction to JSX and understanding it's features
   - 5.Creating and understanding components
   - 6.Rendering, conditional rendering and react fragments
   - 7.Array destructuring in react
   - 8.Using "useState" , "multiple state variables" and working with "useEffect"
   - 9.Updating With the useEffect dependency array
   - 10.Fetching data with useEffefct
   - 11.Using useReducer
   - 12.**Deploying a React app** using [**netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/teams/pegasus-01/overview)


In the **index.js** file in **src** folder, all the operations have been commented for better understanding and none of them are wiped out so a clear concept about the operations can be built through that. And the build version of the app is just deployed and not hosted due to unavailability of domains.
