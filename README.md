   # Learning React

   In this repository, I'll be adding some of my codes which I wrote during the react training course
   from [**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me)



   - **In my first folder [hello-react](https://github.com/Pegasus-01/Learning-React/tree/main/hello-react) , I've added the introductory codes that I've learnt and it contains-   **

     - 1.[Installing the tools](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
     - 2.setting up react developer tools for google chrome
     - 3.Creating elements 
     - 4.Introduction to JSX and understanding it's features
     - 5.Creating and understanding components
     - 6.Rendering, conditional rendering and react fragments
     - 7.Array destructuring in react
     - 8.Using "useState" , "multiple state variables" and working with "useEffect"
     - 9.Updating With the useEffect dependency array
     - 10.Fetching data with useEffefct
     - 11.Using useReducer
     - 12.**Deploying a React app** using [**netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/teams/pegasus-01/overview)




   In the [**index.js**](https://github.com/Pegasus-01/Learning-React/tree/main/hello-react/src) file in [**src**](https://github.com/Pegasus-01/Learning-React/blob/main/hello-    react/src/index.js) folder, all the operations have been commented for better understanding and none of them are wiped out so a clear concept about the operations can be        built through that. And the build version of the app is just deployed and not hosted due to unavailability of domains.


- **In the folder [react interface](#), I've created a fully functioning website interface using React.JS and this contains-**

     - 1.Installation and **Exploring**(I have learnt a lot) a basic react app.
